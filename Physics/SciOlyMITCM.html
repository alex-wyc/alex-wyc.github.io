	<h3>Compound Machines</h3>

	<h4>General Comments</h4>

	<p>This was not an easy test, given how time pressed we were and the difficulty of the test.
	To be completely honest, the content of the test was nothing extraordinary and is in fact
	quite doable, it's just the time pressure that screwed a lot of these over.</p>

	<p>This page will cover mainly the short answers, as I have 0 idea how to do the multiple choice/free response.</p>

	<p><b>Problem 6 (6 pts)</b></p>
	<p>Many odern vinyl turntables are belt drive; a motor with a small
	pulley is coupled to a much larger record platter with a belt. For the audio
	to have the right tempo and pitch, it's critical that the platter spins at \(33\frac{1}{3}\)
	rpm (for most records).</p>
	<p>Suppose a turntable has a platter pulley radius of 12.0 cm and its drive pulley has
	a radius of 1.00 cm. Calculate:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>The speed in rpm that the motor must rotate at.</li>
		<li>The mechanical advantage of the belt system.</li>
		<li>The required torque of the motor given that the belt must
		apply 2.00N of force to the platter for it to spin at a constant
		\(33\frac{1}{3}\) rpm.</li>
	</ol>

	<p><b>Solution:</b><p>
	<p>Part 1:</p>
	<p>It is crucial to find out what is being conserved here, and the quantity I used was
	translational displacement along the belt. Given a set amount of time, say 1 minute, the
	distance covered by the rotation of the platter must be covered by the rotation of the
	motor drive. So we first find the translational displacement (\(d_T\)):</p>
	\[
		d_T = 2 \pi (12.0 cm) \times \frac{100}{3} rpm \times 1 min \approx 2510 cm
	\]
	<p>We know that the motor drive, rotating at \(\omega_m\) need to cover 2510 cm within
	1 minute, so we get the following equation:</p>
	\[
		2510 cm = 2 \pi (1.00 cm) \times \omega_m \times 1 min
	\]
	\[
		\boxed{\omega_m = 400. rpm}
	\]
	<p>Part 2:</p>
	<p>This solution assumes that you do not know the formula for the IMA of a belt system. If you do the problem becomes trivial.</p>
	<p>We need to figure out a formula for the IMA of a belt system, the process is quite simple really.
	Since the work done by both are the same, the torque applied must be equal, so we get:</p>
	\[
		R_e \times F_e = R_r \times F_r
	\]
	<p>So we get that:</p>
	\[
		IMA = \frac{F_r}{F_e} = \frac{R_o}{R_e} = \frac{12.0 cm}{1.00 cm} = \boxed{12}
	\]

	<p>Part 3:</p>
	<p>This is just straight forward calculation:</p>
	\[
		\tau = F \times R = 2.00N (1.00 cm) = \boxed{0.0200 Nm}
	\]
