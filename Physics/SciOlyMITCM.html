	<h3>Compound Machines</h3>

	<h4>General Comments</h4>

	<p>This was not an easy test, given how time pressed we were and the difficulty of the test.
	To be completely honest, the content of the test was nothing extraordinary and is in fact
	quite doable, it's just the time pressure that screwed a lot of these over.</p>

	<p>This page will cover mainly the short answers, as I have 0 idea how to do the multiple choice/free response.</p>

	<p><b>Problem 6 (6 pts)</b></p>
	<p>Many odern vinyl turntables are belt drive; a motor with a small
	pulley is coupled to a much larger record platter with a belt. For the audio
	to have the right tempo and pitch, it's critical that the platter spins at \(33\frac{1}{3}\)
	rpm (for most records).</p>
	<p>Suppose a turntable has a platter pulley radius of 12.0 cm and its drive pulley has
	a radius of 1.00 cm. Calculate:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>The speed in rpm that the motor must rotate at.</li>
		<li>The mechanical advantage of the belt system.</li>
		<li>The required torque of the motor given that the belt must
		apply 2.00N of force to the platter for it to spin at a constant
		\(33\frac{1}{3}\) rpm.</li>
	</ol>

	<div id="S6" style="display:none">
	<p><b>Solution:</b><p>
	<p><u>Part 1:</u></p>
	<p>It is crucial to find out what is being conserved here, and the quantity I used was
	translational displacement along the belt. Given a set amount of time, say 1 minute, the
	distance covered by the rotation of the platter must be covered by the rotation of the
	motor drive. So we first find the translational displacement (\(d_T\)):</p>
	\[
		d_T = 2 \pi (12.0 cm) \times \frac{100}{3} rpm \times 1 min \approx 2510 cm
	\]
	<p>We know that the motor drive, rotating at \(\omega_m\) need to cover 2510 cm within
	1 minute, so we get the following equation:</p>
	\[
		2510 cm = 2 \pi (1.00 cm) \times \omega_m \times 1 min
	\]
	\[
		\boxed{\omega_m = 400. rpm}
	\]
	<p><u>Part 2:</u></p>
	<p>This solution assumes that you do not know the formula for the IMA of a belt system. If you do the problem becomes trivial.</p>
	<p>We need to figure out a formula for the IMA of a belt system, the process is quite simple really.
	Since the work done by both are the same, the torque applied must be equal, so we get:</p>
	\[
		R_e \times F_e = R_r \times F_r
	\]
	<p>So we get that:</p>
	\[
		IMA = \frac{F_r}{F_e} = \frac{R_r}{R_e} = \frac{12.0 cm}{1.00 cm} = \boxed{12}
	\]

	<p><u>Part 3:</u></p>
	<p>This is just straight forward calculation:</p>
	\[
		\tau = F \times R = 2.00N (1.00 cm) = \boxed{0.0200 Nm}
	\]

	<p><b>Problem 7 (7 pts)</b></p>
	<p>To hold guitar strings at the right tension, guitar tuning machines uses a
	compound machine with a spur gear, a worm gear, and a wheel/axle (the knob).
	A particular tuning machine has a string peg radius of 3.00 mm (attached to the spur
	gear), a spur gear with 14 teeth and a knob radius of 9.00 mm.</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Calculate the gear ratio of the worm gear system.</li>
		<li>When the string is tuned with 3.84 N of force on the ends of the knob, the string's
		tension is 100. N. Calculate the efficiency of the tuning machine system.</li>
		<li>Suppose a string is tune at a tension of 80.0 N and you apply
		a lubricant that increases the efficiency found above by 0.200. Calculate
		the force in newtons you must apply to the ends of the knob.</li>
	</ol>
	<div id="S7" style="display:none">
	<p>Side note: Unlike the last question, I was not able to do this question without looking stuff up...</p>
	<p><u>Part 1:</u></p>
	<p>So what is a gear ratio? A gear ratio is the amount by which the gear slows down the rotation
	of the system. For a worm gear, the ratio is teeth count : 1, so the ratio of this worm gear is
	\(\boxed{14:1}\).</p>

	<p><u>Part 2:</u></p>
	<p>The problem basically gives us the AMA of the system, which is \(\frac{100. N}{3.84 N} = 26.0\).
	However, in order to find the efficiency, we need to know the IMA.</p>
	<p>Ok nevermind, I don't know how to do this.</p>

	<p><b>Problem 8 (7 pts)</b></p>
	<p>Your Bungee Drop teammates need help! They ask you to devise a clamp to anchor
	their bungee device that can be hand-tightened to the correct pressure for maximum
	convenience. They've determined that the clamp must exert 210. N of force on the
	bungee device to hold it and request that it can be tightened with only 5.00 N of
	effort. The clamp will use a lever coupled to a screw, similar to many vises. The
	only screw available for the clamp has an outside diameter of 12.0mm and a pitch of 2.0mm.
	Calculate the minimum lever length needed to satisfy their requirements.</p>

	<div id="S8" style="display:none">
	<p>So bascially, your team mate want a wheel-axel-screen system that will amplify
	a 5.00 N force to a 210. N force. So the IMA of said machine is 42.0</p>
	<p>The screw part of the system has a mechanical advantage of \(\frac{(12.0 mm) \pi}{2.00 mm} = 18.8\).
	This means that the wheel-axel system need to have an IMA of \(42.0 \div 18.8 = 2.23\) to
	make this work.</p>
	<p>So, we just have to solve for \(R_w\):</p>
	\[
		\frac{R_w}{12.0mm \div 2} = 2.23
	\]
	\[
		R_w = 2.23 \times 6.00 mm = \boxed{13.4 mm}
	\]
