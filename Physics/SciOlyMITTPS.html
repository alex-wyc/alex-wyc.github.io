	<h3>Technical Problem Solving</h3>

	<h4>General Comments</h4>
	<p>This was a really easy/doable test, the best strategy here is to have one person do
	the experiment and have the other guy work on the supplemental questions.</p>
	<p>This page will only cover the supplemental questions as I have no idea how to use a TI-NSPIRE</p>

	<h4>Station 1 - Thermodynamics</h4>
	<p>1. What is Newton’s Law of Cooling? How does the experiment you ran in station 1
	affected or modeled by this law? What are the differences between this law and your
	best fit model, and	which more accurately models this rate of cooling? (10 points)<p>

	<p>Answer:</p>
	<p>Newton's Law of Cooling:</p>
	\[
		T(t) = T_a + (T_i - T_a)e^{-kt}
	\]
	<p>It states that there is a negative exponential relationship between the temperature
	and time of an object under the influence of the surrounding.
	In the experiment we just conducted,there was a change in temperature
	within the water due to external influence, and therefore can be modelled using Newton's Law
	of cooling, we can find K using the measurements and use it to predict future
	changes in temperature. However, the law and the experiment are not completely the same
	in that Newton's Law of Cooling assumes a static environment with no outside influence
	except the difference in temperature, which is not the case here. However, in the long
	run, Newton's Law of Cooling is still the preferred model in that the experimental measure (almost
	linear) relies severely on the sample size, which is pretty small in this case.</p>

	<p>2. What are the limitations to either Newton’s Law of Cooling or your model of best fit? Why is
	extrapolation not always accurate, and what factors can affect the rate of cooling outside the model?
	(9 points)</p>

	<p>Answer:</p>
	<p>Newton's Law of Cooling has a lot of limitations which causes errors when applied to real
	world scenario. For example, the law assumes that k and ambiance temperature are constant and time-independent, however
	that is not true in a lot of cases, k and ambiance temperature is often dependent on time as well as other
	unaccounted factors. k, for example is dependent upon the geometry, specific heat values and
	temperatures, which are unlikely to be static in real life situations. Small sample
	size causes inaccuracy in </p>
